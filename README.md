Alarm fatigue refers to a state of desensitization to alarms, where healthcare professionals become overwhelmed and fail to respond appropriately to critical alerts. This problem has been attributed to over 550 deaths in the three-year period from 2005 to 2008.
We believe that a solution to this problem is to directly alert nurses via text messages, push notifications, and emails directly when ECG data indicates a patient's health is in critical condition.
